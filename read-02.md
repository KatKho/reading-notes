# The Coder's Computer

1. What are four important features to look for in a text editor?
   - code completion, syntax highlighting, a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue), and the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.
2. What do the following commands do?
> 1. pwd
> - outputs the full path name of your current directory
> 2. ls
> - lists files or directories
> 3. cd
> - changes directory
> 4. mkdir
> - creates a directory
> 5. touch
> - creates a file
3. Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)
> 1. cd projects
> - changes the directory to directory 'projects'
> 2. mkdir new-project
> - creates a new directory named "new-project'
> 3. touch new-project/newfile.md
> - creates a new file named 'newfile' inside the new-project directory
> 4. cd ..
> - goes to as parental directory (up)
> 5. ls projects/new-project
> - lists files and directories inside the 'new-project' directory
