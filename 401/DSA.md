# Data Structures and Algorithms

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
   - Consider the memory requirements of your data structure. Arrays tend to be memory-efficient, while other structures like hash tables can use more memory due to their internal storage mechanisms.
2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
   - Ensure you have a base case in your recursive function, which serves as the condition that stops the recursion and provides a final result. Failing to establish a base case could lead to endless recursion.
