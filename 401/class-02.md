# Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD

This topic covers NodeJS and Express as a web development framework, NPM for package management, the importance of testing (TDD), benefits of Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery vs. Continuous Deployment, and the role of GitHub in development collaboration and automation.

## An introduction to NodeJS and Express

1. Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.
   - Middleware in Express are like helpers that process web requests and responses, performing tasks like data validation and authentication.
2. Express the most popular __ __ ____.
   - Express the most popular framework for building web applications in Node.js.
3. Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?
   - Express is "unopinionated," meaning it allows developers flexibility in how they build web apps, rather than imposing strict rules.
4. What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?
   - Modules are small, reusable pieces of code, like Lego bricks, that make development more efficient and organized by enabling code reuse and collaboration.

## What is NPM?

1. What version of npm are you running on your machine?
   - 9.8.1
2. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?
   - npm install jshint

## What is TDD?

1. Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.
   - Testing in software is like safety checks in building a house. It ensures software works correctly, is reliable, and saves time and money.
2. What are three expected benefits of testing
   - Reliability: Tested software is less likely to crash.
   - Confidence: It works well under pressure.
   - Savings: Catching problems early saves time and money.
3. Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.
   - Individuals: Forgetting unusual cases or testing too much.
   - Teams: Lack of collaboration or skipping tests can lead to issues.

## CI/CD

1. What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?
   - Early Issue Detection: Find and fix problems in software early.
   - Enhanced Collaboration: Encourages teamwork and seamless code integration.
   - Faster Delivery: Automates testing and speeds up software releases.
2. What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?
   - Continuous Delivery: Software is prepared for release but needs human approval.
   - Continuous Deployment: Software is automatically deployed without human intervention.
3. Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background
   - GitHub is like a digital project manager and workspace for developers, helping them collaborate, store code, and automate tasks, making software development more efficient and reliable.

## Reflection

1. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
   - I aim to have the ability to revisit and reference the topics and themes we've covered in the course, considering the extensive content we're learning.
