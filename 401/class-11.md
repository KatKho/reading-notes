# Event Driven Applications

Event Driven Programming, facilitated by Node.js's "events" module and often complemented by Object Oriented Programming, is pivotal for developing responsive and efficient software. It enables applications to react dynamically to events or user actions, enhancing performance and scalability. This approach is essential for creating interactive, real-time applications, making it a fundamental concept in modern web and server-side development.

## Event Driven Programming

1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
   - To start Event Driven Programming in Node.js, use the "events" module with the EventEmitter class.
2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?
   - Object Oriented Programming (OOP) helps organize event-related code, making it modular and reusable.
3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.
   - On the backend with Node.js, Event Driven Programming is like a restaurant buzzer. It lets the server efficiently respond to events (e.g., new users) instead of constantly checking.
