## Emotional Intelligence

Based on my scores, it seems that I have a strong level of Self-Awareness, scoring 21. This suggests that I have a good understanding of my own emotions and how they impact my thoughts and actions. However, my scores in Self-Management and Relationship Management are all below 18, indicating areas where I could focus on improvement. In Self-Management and Relationship Management, there is an opportunity for me to enhance my ability to regulate my own emotions and effectively manage my relationships with others.

## Assessing Bias

My results from the Bias Self-Assessment indicate that I scored 83 out of 120. This assessment has provided me with valuable insights into my biases and areas for growth. It's important to note that this assessment isn't about identifying what I'm doing wrong, but rather an opportunity to understand where my strengths lie and where I can continue to improve.

Upon reviewing my results, it's evident that my lowest score was in the empathy and curiosity category. I'm committed to addressing this aspect in the coming weeks and beyond, as I believe that enhancing empathy and curiosity is vital for creating a more inclusive and understanding environment.
