# Application State with Redux

## Dan Abramov Redux Tutorials

### What is the first principle of Redux?

The first principle is to store the entire application state in a single store.

### What is a store and what do we use our reducers for within that store?

A store holds the application's state. Reducers are functions that specify how the state changes in response to actions.

### Name three Redux store methods given to us by createStore and describe their use.

1. `getState`: Returns the current state.
2. `dispatch`: Dispatches an action to update the state.
3. `subscribe`: Adds a listener for state changes.

### Explain to a non-technical recruiter what combineReducers() does and why it is useful.

`combineReducers` allows you to combine multiple reducers into one, making it easier to manage and organize your code.
