# MongoDB and Mongoose

This topic covers the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases, with a focus on MongoDB and the Mongoose library. The comparison highlights key distinctions between the two database types, such as their structure, schema, data models, and flexibility. It also delves into the advantages and disadvantages of both SQL and NoSQL databases.

## nosql vs sql

1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

|      SQL         |          NoSQL           |
| --------------- | ---------------------- |
| Structured     | Flexible data model   |
| Predefined schema | Schema-less or dynamic schema |
| Table-based    | Various data models (document, key-value, etc.) |
| Relational     | Non-relational       |
| ACID transactions | Eventual consistency and flexibility |

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
   - Structured data with well-defined schemas, where relationships between tables are clearly defined.
2. Give a real world example.
   - An online e-commerce platform.
3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
   - Unstructured or semi-structured data where the schema is not fixed and can evolve over time.
4. Give a real world example.
   - Instagram.
5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
   - A document-based NoSQL database.
6. Which type of database is best for scalability?
   - NoSQL databases.

## sql vs nosql (Video)

1. What does SQL stand for?
   - Structured Query Language.
2. What is a relational database?
   - Organizes data in tables with rows and columns. Relationships are established through keys.
3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
   - Handles unstructured or semi-structured data, offering high scalability and flexibility.
4. What is a ‘schema’?
   - Defines the structure of a database, including tables, columns, and relationships in relational databases.
5. What is a NoSQL database?
   - NoSQL databases are a class of databases that deviate from the traditional relational model.
6. How does it work?
   - NoSQL databases work based on various data models, such as document, key-value, column-family, and graph.
7. What is inside of a MongoDB database?
   - Inside a MongoDB database, data is stored in BSON (Binary JSON) format, where documents (equivalent to records in SQL) are organized into collections (similar to tables in SQL).
8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
   - MongoDB tends to be more flexible than traditional SQL databases because it doesn't enforce a rigid schema.
9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
    - One major disadvantage of NoSQL databases is the potential lack of transactional support and complex querying capabilities compared to traditional relational databases.
