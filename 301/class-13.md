# More CRUD

This topic examines the integration of CRUD operations and RESTful APIs in web development. CRUD's data manipulation actions align with REST's architectural principles, allowing efficient API design. Understanding this connection is crucial for building organized and scalable APIs, ensuring effective data management and communication between clients and servers.

## CRUD Basics

1. Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?
   - PUT or PATCH
2. Which REST methods require an ID parameter?
   - GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE

## Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API

1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?
   - REST and CRUD are interconnected concepts in web development. RESTful architecture aligns closely with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing data. REST maps CRUD actions to HTTP methods, making it a structured way to build APIs that follow these operations.
2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
   - Design Resources: Identify data entities and their attributes.
   - HTTP Methods: Assign CRUD actions to HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT/PATCH, DELETE).
   - Define URIs: Create clear, hierarchical URIs for resources.
   - Implement Logic: Develop backend code to handle requests using frameworks.
   - Response Handling: Ensure proper status codes and formats (e.g., JSON) for responses.
