# REST

Understanding concepts like the HTTP protocol, REST architecture, and various HTTP request methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH) is crucial for comprehending how data is exchanged on the internet. These foundational principles underpin web communication, enabling seamless interaction between clients (such as browsers and applications) and servers. Grasping these concepts is essential for developers, system architects, and anyone involved in web-related work, as they form the basis for designing efficient, standardized, and interoperable systems that power the modern digital landscape.

## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

1. To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience?
   - In my previous professional setting in the military, the presence of a strict leadership policy occasionally created a reluctance among team members to openly express their thoughts due to fear of potential repercussions. The hierarchical structure might have hindered open communication and the sharing of ideas. However, efforts were made to foster a positive and supportive environment within the team. Additionally, having a diverse team with individuals from different backgrounds and experiences had the potential to contribute positively to the overall team dynamics. Despite some challenges, the combination of a supportive atmosphere and diverse perspectives might have played a role in influencing the team’s psychological safety.

2. Why don’t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
   - Traditional methods don't work for talking to all machines globally due to their limited scope and scale, unlike the HTTP protocol designed for the internet.
3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
   - It's the foundation of web communication, co-authored by Fielding, enabling browsers to request and exchange data from web servers.
