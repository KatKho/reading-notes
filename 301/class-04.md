# React and Forms

Mastering controlled components in React forms ensures dynamic user interfaces with real-time updates, while the ternary operator simplifies coding decisions for cleaner, efficient code across languages, collectively boosting code quality and user experience.

## React Docs - Forms

1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
   - An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.
2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
   - It is recommended to update the state with the user's responses as soon as they enter them. It offers benefits like real-time feedback, validation, and progress tracking.
3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
   - When you have an event handler on an input field in React, you can target what the user is entering by accessing the event object passed to the event handler function.
