# Functional Programming

Functional programming is crucial for writing reliable code by treating computations as mathematical functions, ensuring predictability and facilitating testing. It emphasizes pure functions, immutability, and referential transparency. Similarly, modules and the 'require()' mechanism are vital in organizing code and enabling code reuse by encapsulating code units and integrating external functionality, ultimately leading to better code quality and maintainability.

## Functional Programming Concepts

1. What is functional programming?
   - Functional programming is a coding approach that treats computations as math-like functions. It focuses on immutable data, pure functions, and avoiding side effects.
2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
   - A pure function always gives the same output for the same input and has no side effects. It relies only on inputs and doesn't change external things.
3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
   - Benefits of pure functions include predictability, easy testing, and safe parallel processing due to no reliance on shared state.
4. What is immutability?
   - Immutability means data can't be changed after creation.
5. What is Referential transparency?
   - Referential transparency means you can replace a function call with its result without altering a program's behavior.

1. What is a module?
   - A module is a self-contained code unit holding functions and data.
2. What does the word ‘require’ do?
   - Require brings external modules into code.
3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
   - Use import or require to add modules to your file.
4. What do we have to do to make a module available?
   - Export elements you want to share to make a module available.
