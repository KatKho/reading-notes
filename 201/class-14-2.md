Psychologically safe teams thrive on trust, mutual respect, and open communication. These factors create an environment where team members feel valued, respected, and empowered to contribute their best efforts. Such teams have a significant impact, fostering collaboration, innovation, and overall well-being for both the company and the team members.

1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?
   - Trust: Trust is the foundation of a psychologically safe team. Team members must feel confident that they can rely on each other, share their thoughts and ideas without fear of judgment, and know that their colleagues have their backs.
   - Mutual Respect: Mutual respect involves recognizing and valuing the contributions of every team member. It means treating each other with dignity, listening actively to different viewpoints, and appreciating the diversity of experiences and perspectives within the team.
   - Open Communication: Open communication encourages transparent and honest interactions among team members. When team members feel comfortable expressing their thoughts, concerns, and even mistakes, it fosters an environment where constructive feedback can be given and received without negative consequences.

2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
   - In my previous professional setting in the military, the presence of a strict leadership policy occasionally created a reluctance among team members to openly express their thoughts due to fear of potential repercussions. The hierarchical structure might have hindered open communication and the sharing of ideas. However, efforts were made to foster a positive and supportive environment within the team. Additionally, having a diverse team with individuals from different backgrounds and experiences had the potential to contribute positively to the overall team dynamics. Despite some challenges, the combination of a supportive atmosphere and diverse perspectives might have played a role in influencing the team's psychological safety.

3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
   - Teams that prioritize psychological safety create a work environment where team members feel valued, respected, and empowered to contribute their best efforts, resulting in positive outcomes for both the company and the individuals within the team.
