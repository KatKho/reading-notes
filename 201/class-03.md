Understanding HTML elements and CSS properties like ordered and unordered lists, as well as the box model, is crucial for structuring and styling web pages effectively. Additionally, learning JavaScript concepts such as arrays, operators, expressions, conditionals, and loops provides the foundation for creating dynamic and interactive web applications. Mastering these concepts is essential for anyone studying web development as they form the basis for building functional and visually appealing websites. 

## Learn HTML. Ordered and Unordered lists.

1. When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?
   - The unordered list is for grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless.
2. How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?
   - By using CSS it is possible to change the bullet style.
3. When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?
   - Whnever you need to have a specific order or sequence.
4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?
   - You can use specific attributes such as start or type. 

## Learn CSS. The Box Model.

1. Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?
   - Once upon a time, in a land called CSS Kingdom, there stood a magnificent castle known as "The Box Model." The castle had a crucial line of defense encircling its walls, known as "Margin." Like a protective moat, Margin created a buffer zone around the castle, safeguarding it from the outside world. Inside the castle walls, there existed a secondary layer of protection called "Padding." This layer was entrusted with the vital task of guarding all the citizens within the castle—the Content. 
2. List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.
   - Content box: The area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like inline-size and block-size or width and height.
    Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties.
    Border box: The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using border and related properties.
    Margin box: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using margin and related properties.

## Learn JS. Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops.

1. What data types can you store inside of an Array?
   - Strings, Numbers, Booleans, Null, Undefined
2. Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?
   - Yes, it is a valif array. The values can be accessed by their index number.
3. List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.
   - Assignment operators - (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. 
   - Addition assignment - (+=) operator performs addition
   - Subtraction assignment	- (-=) operator performs subtraction on the two operands and assigns the result to the left operand.
   - Multiplication assignment	- (*=) operator performs multiplication on the two operands and assigns the result to the left operand.
   - Division assignment - (/=) operator performs division on the two operands and assigns the result to the left operand.
4. Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.
   '10dog' , since a + b is 10 + false(0), so it would be still 10, and + a string 'dog' turns the expression to a string '10dog'
5. Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.
   - Whenever you decide where you want to eat based on your food preferences.
6. Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.
   - Whenever you need to repeat the same thing over and over again.
