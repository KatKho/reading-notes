CSS Flexbox is a fundamental aspect of web development that allows developers to create flexible and responsive layouts. It provides a powerful toolset for positioning and aligning elements within a container. By understanding and utilizing Flexbox, developers can easily create visually appealing designs, adapt to different screen sizes, and improve the overall user experience of their websites.

## Learn CSS - Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
   - When a flex container wraps it creates multiple flex lines. In terms of space distribution, each line acts like a new flex container. Therefore if you are wrapping rows, it is not possible to get something in row 2 to line up with something above it in row 1. This is what is meant by flexbox being one-dimensional.
  
2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
   - The key to understanding flexbox is to understand the concept of a main axis and a cross axis. The main axis is the one set by your flex-direction property. If that is row your main axis is along the row, if it is column your main axis is along the column.
   - The cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis, so if flex-direction is row the cross axis runs along the column.
  
3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
   - This is important to understand as the logical order is the order that a screen reader will read out the content, and anyone navigating using the keyboard will follow.
