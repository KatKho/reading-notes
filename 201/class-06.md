Understanding JavaScript objects and the DOM is crucial for web development. These concepts form the foundation of front-end development, allowing us to organize data, build powerful applications, and create dynamic web pages. By studying these topics, we gain the knowledge and skills needed to create engaging and interactive web experiences.

## JavaScript Object Basics

1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
   - Imagine you have a car. A car can be represented as an object. It has various characteristics and functionalities associated with it.
2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?
   - It is beneficial to use object literal when you want to transfer a series of structured, related data items in some manner, for example sending a request to the server to be put into a database.
3. How do objects differ from arrays?
   - Arrays are suited for ordered lists of similar items, while objects are useful for organizing structured data with named properties. Objects provide more flexibility in accessing data by specific keys, whereas arrays provide convenient methods for iteration and manipulation.
4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.
   - For example, if an object property name is held in a variable, then you can't use dot notation to access the value, but you can access the value using bracket notation.
5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?
   - In the humanAge method, the term this refers to the current object (dog) that the method is being called on. When this.name and this.age are accessed within the method, they refer to the name and age properties of the dog object. The advantage of using this is that it allows you to access and use the properties and methods of the current object within its own scope. 

## Introduction To The DOM

1. What is the DOM?
   - The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.
2. Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.
   - As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
