Understanding HTML media, image usage, and CSS color and styling is crucial in this module. These topics impact accessibility, visual appeal, and user experience. For example, using alt attributes provides textual descriptions for images, enhancing accessibility. The figure element organizes figures with captions. In CSS, foreground colors affect text while background colors fill space. Font choices, sizes, weights, and styles impact readability and aesthetics. Adding spacing around characters improves text appearance. These skills enable me to create accessible and visually appealing websites.

## HTML Media. Using Images In HTML

1. What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?
   - Its value is supposed to be a textual description of the image, for use in situations where the image cannot be seen/displayed or takes a long time to render because of a slow internet connection.
2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?
   - From an accessibility viewpoint, captions and alt text have distinct roles. Captions benefit even people who can see the image, whereas alt text provides the same functionality as an absent image.
3. Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.
   - To provide a semantic container for figures, and to clearly link the figure to the caption. Provides essential information supporting the main text.
4. Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.
   - GIF images are like short animated clips, while SVG images are like digital drawings that can be resized without losing quality. Both types of images have their uses and can add visual appeal to websites, messages, and other digital platforms.
5. What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?
   - PNG is probably your best bet, but lossless WebP is arguably going to be better compressed.

2. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?

3. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?
   - We should take into consideration whether a font is a 'web safe font' or not.
4. What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?
