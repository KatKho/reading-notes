These topics include creating hyperlinks in HTML, understanding normal flow and positioning in CSS, differentiating between function declaration and invocation in JavaScript, and exploring the benefits of pair programming.

## Learn HTML. Creating Hyperlinks.

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
   - Inside an 'a' element and using the 'href' attribute.
2. The href attribute contains what information?
   - It contains the web address.
3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
   - Include keywords in your link text, use descriptive link text.

## CSS Layout. CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning.

1. What is meant by “normal flow”?
   - The default layout for CSS elements.
2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
   - Block-level elements create line breaks, occupy the full width available, and can contain other block-level and inline elements, while inline elements flow within the text, do not cause line breaks, and have a width and height determined by their content.
3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.
   - Static
4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
   - We can create isolated UI features that don't interfer with the layout of other element on the page
   - Precise placement of an element
5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
   -  Whereas absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.
  
## Learn JS. Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code.

1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
   - Creation of function is also known as function declaration. To invoke a function is the same as to run or execute it.
2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
   - Parameters - these are values that need to be included inside the function parentheses.
   - An argument, on the other hand, is the actual value that is passed to a function or method when it is called.

## Miscellaneous. 6 Reasons for Pair Programming.

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.
   - Learning from fellow students: Pair programming allows you to collaborate closely, learn different approaches, coding styles, and best practices from your partner. It promotes knowledge sharing, problem-solving discussions, and enhances your coding abilities.
   - Job interview readiness: Pair programming helps you prepare for job interviews by practicing articulating your thought process, explaining code, and justifying design choices. It improves your problem-solving and communication skills, making you more confident and effective in technical interviews.
