Understanding the differences between Syntax Errors and Logic Errors in JavaScript is vital for developers to identify and rectify coding issues effectively. Troubleshooting and utilizing tools like the JavaScript Debugger enhance developers' problem-solving skills, leading to improved code quality and faster development cycles. Mastering these skills remains essential for long-term success in software development.

## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
   - Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through â€” you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!
   - Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.
2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
   - I was trying to access a local variable inside a global scope, so I moved it to the global
   - I did not convert String to Numbers. I used parseInt to fix it.
3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
   - I always pay attention to error messages so I will continue to do so.
  
## The JavaScript Debugger

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
   - The JavaScript debugger allows you to watch the value of variables and set breakpoints. It is a very useful tool.
2. Define what a breakpoint is.
    - Breakpoints - places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly.
3. What is the call stack?
   - The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.
